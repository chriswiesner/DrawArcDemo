# Demo Project for slow frames when using drawArc() 

simply drawing arc on a Canvas with `canvas.drawArc()` is causing slow frames

detecting slow frames through `FrameMetricsAggregator`

you can use the buttons to start tracing and then adjust the angle of the arc using the slider

after stopping the tracing the number of slow frames is shown in a text-label
